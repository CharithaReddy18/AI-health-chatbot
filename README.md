# 🤖 Medibot: Your AI-Powered Health Assistant 🩺

An **AI-Powered Health Assistant** that provides users with **health-related guidance**, **symptom analysis**, and **basic medical recommendations** using advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.

Built with **Streamlit** for the frontend and **Hugging Face Transformers** for intelligent responses, this chatbot aims to improve **accessibility to preliminary healthcare advice**, especially for individuals without immediate access to medical professionals.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This chatbot is **not a replacement** for professional medical advice. Always consult a qualified healthcare provider for serious or persistent health issues.

-   Understanding user queries about medical symptoms or health issues.
-   **Rule-based** recommendations for common medical questions.
-   **AI-powered, context-aware responses** for general health inquiries.
-   Assisting users with **appointment guidance**, **medication reminders**, and **basic symptom checks**.

-   💊 **Medication Reminders** – Assists users in remembering their prescribed medications.
-   🔁 **Fallback AI Mode** – Uses Hugging Face's `distilgpt2` to handle a wide range of general health questions, ensuring you get a helpful response even when a specific rule isn't found.
-   🖥️ **Streamlit Web App** – Easy-to-use, browser-accessible interface.
-   📜 **Chat History Storage** – Saves conversations for later reference.
-   🗄 **Medical Database Integration** – Stores and retrieves relevant medical data from FAISS indexes for efficient information retrieval.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

-   **Programming Language:** Python 3
-   **Frontend:** [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) – For its simplicity and speed, allowing us to turn a Python script into a beautiful web app instantly.
-   **NLP Models:** [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) (`distilgpt2`) – Leveraging pre-trained models gives us access to state-of-the-art NLP capabilities for intelligent, context-aware responses.
-   **Database:** FAISS (`index.faiss`, `index.pkl`) – For efficient similarity search and indexing of medical data.
-   **Utilities:** NLTK (optional in current version)
-   **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

---
## Offline Mode Support
If you do not have a `GROQ_API_KEY`, the chatbot now supports **offline mode** using `DistilGPT2` (a local HuggingFace model).  
This allows you to test the chatbot without any API calls.

No extra setup is required — just run:
```bash
python app.py
